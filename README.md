### What is quire? 
Quire is a multifunctional notebook-app that works directly in the browser. This first beta-version saves only locally and has no server or backend which will be implemented at a later stage. 

Quire uses the open-source editor Quill to work properly. 
https://github.com/quilljs/quill


### Features: 
-   Auto-save on text-change
-   Move note to trash
-   Search for specific notes
-   Mark notes as "favourites"
-   Print notes as document/pdf
-   Quill-implemented editor
-   Help-button
-   Add pictures
-   Change font sizes and font styles
-   Dark mode (in progress)


### Upcoming Features: 
-   Permanently delete notes
-   Responsitivity on all mobile devices (in progress)
-   Themes!
-   More fonts!


### How: 
This app doesn't need a manual for anyone to get you writing down your notes. The app saves automatically on every key-press in the editor so you never have to remember where that save-button is located on your screen. 

If you, for any reason, need a helping hand - the help button is there to assist you.
